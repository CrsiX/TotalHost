  <p>In the early game, your assets are meager and easy to deplete. You start the game with
  a yearly income of about one hundred resources and a few hundred kilotons of each mineral.
  To use these meager assets effectively, you&#146;ll need to consider how to balance what
  you <i>need</i> to accomplish with what you <i>want</i> to accomplish. With each step you
  take in the first few years of the game you should be thinking, &quot;What effect will
  this action have on my resource growth?&quot; </p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Population Management">Population Management</a></font> </p>
  <p>To research, build and expand your empire, you need resources. This makes the creation
  of resources the most important element of your early game strategy. Since people (and
  factories) create resources, increasing your population growth rate should be a main, and
  ongoing, goal.</p>
  <p>Although your race&#146;s standard growth rate is already set during the race design
  process, the actual growth rate for each colony will depend on the habitability and
  population for that colony world. Both low-value worlds and worlds with many colonists
  will grow at a rate lower than the standard (or maximum) racial rate. Once your homeworld
  (or any world) reaches 25% of population capacity, its growth begins to slow. At 30%
  capacity, that world will grow people less rapidly than it did at 25% capacity, but will
  still grow people faster than most other worlds you will find. However, your homeworld
  will probably be the only world at the beginning of the game that starts with a
  habitability value of 100%. Here is a chart of growth, comparing the homeworld's growth
  rate at different capacities to worlds of lesser value:</p>

  <p>This chart doesn&#146;t give us quite enough information to play with, so let's look at
  an example. Say you have two worlds. One of them (your homeworld) is a 100% value world,
  and the other is a 50% value world. You have 1 million people (the normal maximum number
  of people for any world) to spread between the two worlds, and a 10% standard growth rate.
  Here's another chart, showing the growth per planet, and the growth in total, of your
  two-world empire with the population split between the two worlds:</p>

  people were left in freighters so they would not die. Note that, even with 200,000 people

  30% capacity (actually, at 33%). Therefore, to achieve the highest possible growth for
  these two worlds, each year 300,000 people should be on the homeworld, 150,000 people
  should be on the 50% world, and 550,000 people should be in freighters (or, even better,

  <p>In simpler words, when trying to maximize your growth, don&#146;t export
  people to other worlds until the homeworld capacity is somewhere between 30% and 40%,
  because the people will simply grow faster on the homeworld than they would on almost any
  other world. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2"><u>t i p</u><br>
    Wait to export people until the source world&#146;s capacity is somewhere between 30% and
    40%,</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here are some rules of thumb for population growth: <ul>
    <li>Colonize and ramp-up a world that has a habitability value of 90% or greater
      immediately. If you have the same amount of people on both the homeworld and the 90%
      world, they will grow at almost your maximum rate, until each world reaches 33% capacity.
      This gives you, basically, 2 homeworlds.</li>
    <li>A world with a habitability value of 50% or better should be ramped up before the
      homeworld capacity is over 35%.</li>
    <li>Worlds with a habitability value of less than 50% should wait until all other available
      worlds are filled, and should not be filled until the homeworld is over 33% of capacity.
      Generally, homeworld capacity should never go above 40% in the early growth years.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you can&#146;t find nearby worlds with a value greater than 50%, you should consider
  going back to your race and fixing whatever is wrong with the habitability settings. Be
  glad you found this in a testbed instead of a real game. (You are still in the testbed
  stage, aren't you?).</p>
  <p>So, in the beginning, sit on your homeworld building factories and (if you run out of
  Germanium) mines, waiting for your population to become ripe for expansion. Send out your
  scouts and find those high value worlds, and then wait. Once you colonize a world, send
  enough people to increase its population to 25% of that world&#146;s capacity, so it can
  start industrializing itself and, possibly, act as a seed (or breeder) world for new
  colonies on yet more worlds. This way your high value worlds serve as &quot;little
  homeworlds&quot; that provide new bases for expansion.</p>
  <p>However, the needs of your empire's expansion and claiming of territory may end up
  being more important than simple maximization of growth. Remember that the universe is
  full of other races that want those planets as badly as you do. </p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Building your Resource Base">Building your Resource Base</a></font> </p>
  <p>People also aren't the entire story. Your main resource supply is your number of
  Factories per world. There are three key factors that govern factory production:
  Population, Other Factories, and Mines.</p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Population">Population</a></font></p>
  <p>The more people you have, the more factories you can build (because those people create
  resources) and the more factories you can run in a year. As a general rule, you should
  always have enough people on a world to run all factories already produced. Otherwise,
  you&#146;ve wasted the resources used in their creation.</p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Factories">Factories</a></font></p>
  <p>The more factories on a planet, the more resources your planet will have to build more
  factories. This is known as the &quot;compounding effect of factories&quot;&#151;a very
  powerful effect. Using the default settings in the Race wizard, one factory produces
  enough resources to, by itself, build another factory in 10 years. Those two factories
  will then, together, build another factory in five years, for a total of three after 15
  years. About three years later, you will get another factory, and two years later another.
  Now, you have five factories after a mere 21 years, all produced from the resources of
  that first ancestral factory. Those five factories can build another factory every two
  years and each factory immediately goes into production building more. Therefore, for
  every factory you do not build early on (or that you build, but do not run) is sacrificing
  one extra factory 10 years down the road, five factories 21 years down the road, or ten
  factories 29 years down the road. It just gets worse from there.</p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Mines">Mines</a></font></p>
  <p>Of course, if you run out of minerals, factory production will halt immediately. This
  is where mines (local and remote) come in. You need Germanium to build Factories, and
  you've got to pull a lot of it out of the soil to build the number of factories a
  fully-industrialized world needs. While you may temporarily have to pull resources from
  building factories to build your mines, mines cost no more resources to run. Once a mine is
  built, it will pull minerals from your world until the end of time (though the mineral
  concentration of the providing world will slowly decrease).</p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Managing Your Production Queue">Managing Your Production Queue</a></font> </p>
  <p>It's time to consider your world's Production Queue and, in particular, your Default
  Production Queue. What is an effective production queue? What should it contain, and in
  what order? How are all the different things interrelated?</p>
  <p>Here is a simple Production Queue: <ul>
    <li>Build Up To 500 Factories</li>
    <li>Build Up To 500 Mines</li>
    <li>Terraform Up to 10%</li>
    <li>Build Up To 10 Defenses</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This production queue tells your world to do the following: <ul>
    <li>Build factories until you either run out of resources, or you run out of Germanium. If
      you've run out of resources, great. Stop there.</li>
    <li>If you have run out of Germanium <i>and have left over resources</i>, build mines so you
      can have more Germanium for next year's factory production.</li>
    <li>If you've built the maximum number of factories and mines that can be run by the current
      population, then the limiting factor is not Germanium or Resources, but People. Terraform
      the world so that more people can live there, and so that the current inhabitants can
      reproduce faster.</li>
    <li>If the world is fully industrialized, build a few defenses, just in case.</li>
    <li>If you still have resources left over after getting all the way through this list,
      allocate them into global research.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most of your worlds would start a queue like this with just the first item being done
  each year. As Germanium runs low, the first two items will start to be done each year, and
  your world will be on it's way to industrialization. Once Terraforming begins, your world
  will be ready to consider either building ships or devoting itself to research. Once
  Terraforming finishes, this world will probably be able to build ships and still
  contribute to research.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, however, you will be stuck on a world with low Germanium. This world will
  never seem to have enough factories, and will therefore be a low resource world. Instead
  of relying on the planet's own Germanium content, you should seriously consider finding
  other sources.</p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Managing Your Minerals">Managing Your Minerals</a></font> </p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Germanium">Germanium</font></p>
  <p>Your first critical mineral is Germanium. Every world will need it, and no world will
  have enough. About the time your fledgling colonies start to require a lot of Germanium,
  your homeworld will be running out of its own supply. Where are you going to get enough
  Germanium for all your worlds? </p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Remote Mining">Remote Mining</a></font></p>
  <p>Just before you would start to run out of Germanium is where Remote Mining shines.
  While your homeworld cannot supply Germanium, it can usually spare some Ironium (the main
  ingredient in most ships, and especially Remote Mining ships). By building remote mining
  ships, your homeworld is effectively trading some resources and Ironium (plus a little
  Boranium and Germanium) for a nearly endless supply of Germanium from worlds that your
  race wouldn't be using anyway. While those resources could perhaps be used in the building
  of more mines or factories (going against the dictate of 'Thou Shalt Not Compromise Thy
  Resource Growth,') these remote miners, if built at the right time and in the right
  number, will increase your eventual growth rate a few years down the road.</p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Ironium">Ironium</a></font></p>
  <p>Next, your empire will experience its first Ironium Crunch. While the problem with
  Germanium affects how fast you can build your factories, the Ironium problem affects your
  growth in more subtle ways. Without adequate Ironium, you will have trouble building your
  remote miners, in turn affecting your supply of Germanium. Also, without the Ironium, your
  planets will have trouble building the colonizers and freighters (especially Privateer
  colonizers and freighters) needed to move your people and minerals around. To solve your
  Germanium problem, you needed either miners or very rich worlds. To solve your Ironium
  problem, you need planning.</p>
  <p>Until you have made several worlds productive, the main source of Ironium will be your
  homeworld. You&#146;ll start with enough Ironium for quite a few transport, scout, and
  mining vessels. If, however, you build too many of one type, you will quickly realize that
  you don't have enough of another. If the type of ship you don't have enough of is your
  scout, you will potentially lose your eyes on the universe. If you can't build enough
  transports, you will sacrifice much of your growth. If you can't build your miners, you
  may not be able to build scouts or transports either. Every year, you should consider the
  available minerals, and decide what is most important to build.</p>
  <p>Build as many remote miners in a year as you can afford, while still allowing your
  homeworld to increase its factories and mines at a decent rate. Next you will need to
  build a few freighters to haul your mineral wealth home. The homeworld will need enough
  freighters to set up a round trip to at least one nearby planet being remote mined. A
  one-way trip of one year will need two transports (so one is always on its way out, and
  one on its way back), and a two-year trip will need four transports, in order to get
  minerals flowing from the miners to your homeworld as fast as possible. Once these ships
  are under way, you may not have to build more for a few years (when you may need more
  freighters to send colonists or minerals to other planets). During this time, you should
  also build one or two scouts every year, first to send out exploring, then to patrol your
  space. Remember, you will not have current data for any world that is not either being
  orbited or within your yellow penetrating scanner circles, so your scouts should be
  constantly re-scanning any nearby planets (that you haven&#146;t colonized) for other
  players' colonies and incoming ships trying to sneak up on you.</p>
  <p><font FACE="Arial, Helvetica" SIZE="4"><a name="Boranium">Boranium</a></font></p>
  <p>Managing your Boranium supply is easy compared to the other two minerals. Generally,
  you will not need to manage it at all, for it isn&#146;t very important early on in the
  game. A world that is very low in Boranium may need one small (less than 50kT) shipment,
  just so it can build a space station and possibly a few freighters. Also, if you need to
  build a lot of beam-weapon attack craft, you will have to do so on worlds that have a
  decent Boranium supply. Other than that, you can usually ignore Boranium.</p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Building Only What You Need">Building Only What You Need</a></font> </p>
  <p>Until you have built the core of an effective empire, you need to constantly
  monitor what you need to build, and find a way to build it as quickly as possible.
  Generally, you should build a ship, or a starbase, only if you can do so in one year's
  time. For Starbases (but not Space Docks, for those of you with Improved Starbases), the
  production time can be spread over two years. For ships, two years is too long. A ship
  that takes two years to build halts all factory and mine production for that first year,
  greatly slowing down your growth.</p>
  <p>It is important to note that, unlike colonizers, freighters are reusable until their
  design is made obsolescent by higher technology (and even then, they are still useful, but
  take up a ship design slot). Once your homeworld stops sending people to nearby worlds,
  the freighters formerly dedicated to that task can be turned to exporting people from your
  well-established or breeder worlds to neighboring worlds, or to collecting and
  distributing minerals. This strategy allows you to slow freighter production after the
  initial investment. You can also move some of these older freighters to worlds with low
  mineral content, saving your minerals and resources on those worlds for tasks other than
  building freighters.</p>
  <p>Scout production can eventually be halted completely. Once you have explored the edges
  of the universe, and you have enough scouts to cover every planet within your borders
  (and, preferably, beyond your borders as well), there is no need to build more.</p>
  <p>Remote miners, however, can and should be built in any quantity. The more you build,
  the more minerals can be pulled eventually from uncolonizable planets.</p>
  <p>Once you have built enough of these three types of ships (or, at least, enough of the
  Freighters and Scouts) you can turn your attention to other things like building your
  minelayers and warships, and perhaps even doing a little research on the side.</p>
  <p><font SIZE="5" FACE="Arial, Helvetica"><a name="Research">Research</a></font> </p>
  <p>Research? Until now, you will notice that no mention has been made, except in very
  special cases, about your research. With a very few exceptions you should avoid performing
  research early in the game. Any resources your planets have available should be put into
  more important things, like mines and factories, so that your economy will grow. Only
  after all mines, factories, and ships are built should you take the time for the luxury of
  research.</p>
  <p>The exceptions are few, but important to note. Each field of research has a breakpoint
  or two for the early game. Your race may start the game past the breakpoint in one field,
  but will need to reach it in others. Sometimes, you can avoid the need to reach these
  breakpoints with your race design. However, each breakpoint gives you something that will
  help your economy eventually grow at a much faster pace than it would were they avoided.
  Here are some important breakpoints (growth-related and otherwise), and the levels that
  are needed to reach them:</p>

  <p>What do these research breakpoints mean to your growing race? Well, for simple early
  colonization (the first few years), your race can get away with nothing better than decent
  Propulsion technology (Propulsion 2 if you have Improved Fuel Efficiency, otherwise you
  can live with the engine on your first ships). However, once your homeworld and colonies
  begin exporting people, your research levels should be: <ul>
    <li>Energy 1, for the Temperature Terraforming, if you need it. If possible, level 5 gives
      more Terraforming.</li>
    <li>Weapons 1 or 5, for the same reason.</li>
    <li>Propulsion 1 or 5, again for the same reason. If ram scoops are available to your race,
      but you don't have the Fuel Mizer, Propulsion 8 could be a lofty goal, as that gives you
      your first ram scoop that does not kill your colonists.</li>
    <li>Construction 4 is critical for the Privateer hull, which uses little Germanium. If you
      have taken Improved Starbases, you also get the Space Dock.</li>
    <li>Electronics 7 gives you a penetrating scanner (unless you have taken No Advanced
      Scanners) to help you find worlds faster.</li>
    <li>Biotechnology 1 gives you basic (3%) terraforming for any of the first 3 fields that are
      already 1. Biotechnology 2 gives you, for any of the first 3 fields that are 5 or above,
      extra terraforming (7%). If you have Total Terraforming, you should try for Biotechnology
      6.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is all you should research for early on, and if you can justify not researching
  something, by all means do so (almost all of the above can probably be avoided, with the
  exception of the Privateer and the Cargo Pod, which are both available through
  Construction Research to level 4). This small amount of research, however, will help your
  race a great deal in its expansion efforts. Once your homeworld begins experiencing a glut
  of resources, you can turn your thoughts to more lofty research goals. By then, however,
  you will be well into the middle game.</p>
